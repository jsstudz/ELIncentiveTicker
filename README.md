## WIP - EL Incentive/Milestone Ticker  

A simple ticker to pull Incentives and Milestones from DonorDrive's API for Extra Life. It's to be used as a simple browser source within OBS or SLOBS. I will update this as much as possible based on what people want.  

This is free for anyone to use. If you feel so inclined to contribute to my Extra Life page feel free to visit bit.ly/JSStudz. Any little bit helps and keeps me motivated to make more things like this for streamers. Thank you.  

## Instructions:  

  Download as a ZIP file.  
  Unzip file to location of your choosing.  
  Open up main.js in notepad.  
  Under userData, change the participant ID to your participant ID (found on your Extra Life URL page).
  Under userData, adjust the value of marquee speed to speed up/ slow down the marquee  
  You can change Incentives and Milestones to either true or false depending what you want to display on screen.  
  Add as browser source to OBS/SLOBS and change as needed.
